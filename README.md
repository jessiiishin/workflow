Welcome! This is a small desktop productivity app that is built with Electron.js. It is an app that works like a pin board or a desk.
You can put a timer beside your sticky notes, write different todo lists for each thing you have to do, and more!

Widgets currently include:
- Timer
- Todo List
- Sticky Note

You can:
- Spawn widgets (click or drag and drop the buttons on the left menu)
- Clear the whole thing (bottom left, "clear workspace" button)
- Close the app and restart to see your widgets still well and healthy (auto save)
- Use the timer, todo list, or sticky notes
- Drag the widgets around (grab by the title)
- Rename the widgets (double click the title)
